## 1. Introduction

Le Shef is an application that allows you to cook multiple frozen meals at the same time in the oven. Whether it's Egg Rolls & Pizza or French Fries and Quiche, you can do it all with Le Shef.

- Step 1. Input the cook time and temperature of each item into the app. Using the magic of technology, we will give you a single temperature to set your oven to.

- Step 2. The app will tell you when to place each item in the oven. You can set the instructions to start cooking everything at one time, or to stagger each item so that everything is finished cooking at the same time!

- Step 3. Eat your delicious, perfectly cooked food!
